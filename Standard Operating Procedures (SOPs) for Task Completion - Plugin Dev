Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for Task Completion

1. Development
Objective: Ensure all tasks are completed efficiently, adhering to coding standards and best practices.
1.1 Task Breakdown
Process:
Analyze Task: Review the task requirements and sub-tasks.
Create Sub-Tasks: Break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable sub-tasks.
Define Acceptance Criteria: Document clear acceptance criteria for each sub-task.
1.2 Development Workflow
Process:
Set Up Development Environment: Ensure all necessary tools, frameworks, and environments are ready.
Write Code: Develop according to the requirements and sub-tasks.
Follow PSR standards (PSR-1, PSR-2, PSR-4) for PHP code:
PSR-1: Basic Coding Standard
PSR-2: Coding Style Guide
PSR-4: Autoloading Standard
Naming Conventions: Use meaningful names for classes, methods, and variables.
Code Comments: Add comments where necessary to explain complex logic.
Regular Commits: Commit changes frequently with meaningful commit messages.
1.3 Task Integration
Process:
Integrate Changes: Merge code into the main branch.
Resolve Conflicts: Address any merge conflicts that arise.
Run Unit Tests: Ensure all unit tests pass after integration.
1.4 Documentation
Process:
Update Documentation: Document new features, code changes, and updates.
Submit Documentation: Ensure documentation is accessible to all team members.

2. UI/UX Testing
Objective: Validate that the developed feature meets design specifications and user experience requirements.
2.1 Test Preparation
Process:
Review Design Specifications: Ensure understanding of design and UX requirements.
Create Test Cases: Develop test cases based on design specifications and acceptance criteria.
2.2 Execution
Process:
Perform Testing: Execute test cases on different devices and screen sizes.
Document Issues: Record any design or UX issues encountered.
Verify Responsiveness: Ensure the feature works across different devices and screen resolutions.
2.3 Feedback and Iteration
Process:
Communicate Issues: Share findings with the development team.
Retest: Verify that issues are resolved and functionality meets specifications.

3. Responsiveness Testing
Objective: Ensure that the application is responsive and functions well on various devices and screen sizes.
3.1 Test Preparation
Process:
Define Test Scenarios: Outline scenarios for different devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).
Set Up Test Environments: Use tools and devices to test responsiveness.
3.2 Execution
Process:
Test on Devices: Perform tests on actual devices and using emulators.
Check Breakpoints: Ensure that breakpoints are correctly implemented.
Verify Layouts: Check that layouts adjust correctly across different screen sizes.
3.3 Reporting and Fixes
Process:
Document Issues: Record any responsiveness issues found.
Collaborate with Developers: Ensure issues are addressed.
Retest: Verify that fixes have resolved the issues and ensure consistent responsiveness.

4. Code Review
Objective: Ensure code quality and adherence to standards through peer review.
4.1 Preparation
Process:
Submit Code for Review: Push code to the repository and create a pull request.
Provide Context: Include details and context for the review (e.g., changes made, why they were made).
4.2 Review Process
Process:
Review Code: Check for adherence to coding standards (e.g., PSR), functionality, and performance.
PSR Standards: Verify that the code follows PSR-1, PSR-2, and PSR-4.
Best Practices: Ensure that best practices for security, efficiency, and maintainability are followed.
Provide Feedback: Comment on code quality, suggest improvements, and note any issues.
Address Feedback: Make necessary changes based on the feedback provided.
4.3 Approval
Process:
Finalize Review: Confirm that all feedback has been addressed and approve the pull request.
Merge Code: Merge the approved code into the main branch.

5. Task Completion
Objective: Ensure that tasks are fully completed and meet all defined criteria.
5.1 Final Verification
Process:
Test Functionality: Ensure that the feature or fix works as expected.
Confirm Acceptance Criteria: Verify that all acceptance criteria are met.
5.2 Deployment
Process:
Prepare for Deployment: Ensure that all code is merged and ready for deployment.
Deploy Changes: Deploy to the staging or production environment.
Monitor Deployment: Check for any issues post-deployment.
5.3 Documentation and Closure
Process:
Update Task Status: Mark the task as complete in the task management tool.
Document Completion: Document any relevant details, changes made, and lessons learned.
Close Task: Officially close the task and ensure it is removed from the active sprint board.
